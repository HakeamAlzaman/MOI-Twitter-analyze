**Question/needs:**
Studying the analytical data of government agencies to ensure the speed of response to inquiries and reduce the time and effort expended for that through the use of statistical functions that ensure, God willing, sorting out what is reported on the authority’s account on the Twitter platform, providing computer-technical suggestions, and determining how to deal with those tweets quickly

**Data description:** 
Big data is everywhere. Period. In the process of running a successful Governments in today’s day and age, Twitter.com is a gold mine of data. Unlike other social platforms, almost every user’s tweets are completely public and pullable. This is a huge plus if you’re trying to get a large amount of data to run analytics on. Twitter data is also pretty specific. Twitter’s API allows you to do complex queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic within the last twenty minutes, or pull a certain user’s non-retweeted tweets.We can also target users that specifically live in a certain location, which is known as spatial data. Another application of this could be to map the areas on the globe where the account has been mentioned the most.As we can see, Twitter data can be a large door into the insights of the general public, and how they receive a topic. That, combined with the openness and the generous rate limiting of Twitter’s API, can produce powerful results.


**Tools:**
I will be planning to use deep learning model and library. I will be using Mitplot, pandas and numpy library for visualization and calculation. On top of my head those are the tools I can think of. However, going through the model I may come up with another approaches. 



**MVP Goal:**
The importance of this project is related to the large increase in Twitter users in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and what this requires is the importance of interacting with that increase through the use of technology in sorting and classifying all tweets and identifying the important ones to deal with it quickly.
By doing that it Applied contribution to improving the development efforts of man and place in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in light of the evaluation results of the impact of those interactions with social networks .
